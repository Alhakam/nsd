<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span>The Natural Stone Damage Ontology (NSD) is an extension of the <a href="https://alhakam.github.io/dot/">Damage Topology Ontology (DOT)</a> that provides specific classes and properties for describing damages on natural stone structures. In this regard, the developed class taxonomy is based on the classified damage types of the ICOMOS glossary of the International Scientific Committee for Stone. The data properties were developed in the project <a href="https://www.bim-sis.de/">BIM-SIS</a>.</span>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for NSD terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://w3id.org/nsd#</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The suggested prefix for the NSD namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">nsd</span>
